- We need some criteria to tell which model is better, so we define cost function
- The most popular cost function is called squared error, âˆ‘(pred(i)-y(i))^2
- There is a search Problem, which makes us hard to find correct answer by using cost function.
  - If we changed the values more, the speed would be faster but also could fail to find the global minima
  - On the opposite, move slowly and more likely to succeed to find the anwser.
